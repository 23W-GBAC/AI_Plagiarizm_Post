#AI Art Creative Expression or Plagiarism?

As the daughter of a mathematics teacher, I have always been driven to excel academically and make my mother proud. Striving to be the best in my class, I dedicated myself to thoroughly understanding subjects and participating in competitions. Despite meeting expectations, I realized the importance of skills like critical thinking and problem-solving, which I admired in others. This recognition led to my fascination with artificial intelligence (AI), a rapidly growing field that enhances everyday life through computer-based intelligence. 

AI is making a big impact in many industries like healthcare, cars, farming, hotels, making things, and teaching. It helps businesses work better, cut costs, make customers happier, earn more money, and stay ahead of competitors. In the art world, AI is really changing things too. It is making new ways for people and machines to work together in art, bringing new ideas and styles. AI helps artists in practical ways too, like choosing colours or planning their artwork, saving time, and opening up new creative paths.

To really impress people, including my mom, I always engaged in multiple hobbies, ranging from ballet to piano and even the arts. I consistently incorporated art into all my projects to showcase my talent. In 9th grade, I had a project where I needed to present the cell membrane to my classmates. Biology being my least favourite subject, I often struggled with memorizing and fully understanding these processes. That is when I turned to graphic arts. I would draw the cell structure and organelles as I imagined them, drawing inspiration from online platforms, and studying graphic design. I used Adobe Painting, which is now known as Fresco, for my graphic art creations. Here are some examples of my self-created graphic art.

Considering I was a 9th grader presenting to other 9th graders a presentation with self-drawn images, everyone was impressed. All because of graphic art. Nowadays AI can easily generate such photos if you ask it to and way better quality. For example, if I were to ask an AI tool known as ChatGPT 4 to generate an image explaining the fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane it generated such a photo.

What a complex photo. Maybe too detailed for 9th grades. Let’s ask chatGPT4 to simplify it to a photo easy to explain for 9th graders.

Way better, and way better than mine. ChatGPT 4 ChatGPT-4, developed by OpenAI, is an advanced artificial intelligence language model. It belongs to the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, where '4' denotes its iteration in the series. As a state-of-the-art AI, ChatGPT-4 is characterized by its deep learning algorithms, which are based on a transformer architecture. This allows the model to generate human-like text responses and engage in conversations by predicting subsequent words in a sequence. Now let’s not dive deep into AI art generators without learning about the history of AI art.
